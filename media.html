              <h4><a href="">Books</a></h4>
              <p>12 Rules for life - one of the books that changed my life. Right book at the right time. You could call it the inspiration or the words that i needed - the kind of thought process idea i needed to kick me out of feeling sorry for myself. Ive heard a lot of criticism about this book. I dont agree with it. There are worse idealogies out there. He said dont try to be different for the sake of being different. There is nothing wrong with tradition. A lot of people felt offended/attaked by that.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>16 personalities - dont remember content. But again a book which helped me to see a way to define myself. Gave me abetter understanding about myself
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Winter of the witch - nice book series. Different from typical fairytales. There is no clear demarcation about good and evil. Which i really appreciate. Its a western thing to have a clear difference between the two but that isnt always the case. A good read. Enjoyed the ballsy main female character.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Circe - what a wonderful book! Totally unexpected in its quiet intense rhythm. I could relate to the feelings of ‘weakness’, ‘powerlessness’ main character, circe, who through grows and realises how strong she is.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Childeren of blood and bones - hated this book. Bad story writing for a dysfunctional world type trope. Did not like the characters. They were angry and senselessly violent. Kind of hunger games. 
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Eragon - re-read it. Character seems to be a whiny SOB who cant get over feeling sorry for himself. Other characters are not well developed. But story overall was nice.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>The Brain is Plastic - The stories are alright. Not a very exciting book. It pales in comparison to the charisma brimming in Dr Jordan’s book. The stories itself are average and could essentially be reduced to a few sentences and scientific facts. I am wondering if the remaining paras and stories add any value towards the topic the book is trying to address. Didn’t finish the book.

              <h4><a href="">Movies</a></h4>
                <p>Inside Out - Cute movie where feelings of Joy (red), Fear (yellow), Sadness (blue), Anger (red) and Disgust (green) are characters which exist as such inside a persons mind. They have a giant control board as if in a video game and they share the controls among them. Their main aim is to regulate daily life emotionally and physically and store memories.
                The story followed how these characters matured and grew to realise each others importance. The movie reflected that all memories that are created have several feelings attached to it.
                Cute ideas and a creative way to express the idea of memories, consciousness, core values and feelings.

              <p>GTO - Great Teacher Onizuka indeed! A complete delinquent himself. Young, brash and didnt care about the what the world thought, did things his way which were extreme but maybe that was what was needed. The students could relate to him. Didnt take anyone’s BS. i forgot why he wanted to be a teacher.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Black bullet - dont remember too much. It was a good watch though
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>B:the beginning - Another one i dont remember but appreciated because it wasnt a complete good/evil dichotism
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Kimetsu no yaiba - good action anime/mange. Powers and their development are not over the top. He took a bloody two years to ‘master’ the technique. He had very apparent limits. Characters could ger hurt, were fallible, could die. All of this wasnt romanticized.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Sousei no onmyouji - dont remember. Good watch.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Ao no exorcist
              Story about a boy who was born of Satan and how he uses his powers and ‘compassion’ to understand humans and demons to bring them closer.
              The plot was alright but the characters.. had a huge gaping holes in terms of motivation and intent. Why did the mother let Satan take over her body? How do you even get pregnant if a ‘spirit is possessing you? Why was Satan just casually roaming around earth on a ‘holiday’? Why was the twin okay with his brother being the reason his foster father died? Why did the Father decide to adopt two demon boys? Where the fuck does Sir Pheles figure into this? No explanation at all. What about Sir Pheles’ brother? The council allowing Satan’s son to live – wtf? .. a lot of stuff whose explanation is upto the viewer to figure out. Maybe these glaring holes will be answered in the next season but I will not be watching it.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Food Wars
              Simple to follow story about a cooking student who wants to become the best and beat his dad in friendly competition. I like his character – simple, creative and not afraid to break the rules and think out of the box. Since it’s an anime these out of the box actions never ever seem to have negative outcomes. The point I take away is that he is not upset by failure – it is a challenge to be attempted again. He cherishes the people around him and feels stronger because of them. This was my favourite character in the show and inspires me. Having said that, the food reactions are over-the-top.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Noragami
                Is the story of a stray, little-known God (Yato) whose path crosses with a high-schooler (Hiyori) whose spirit is loosely connected to her body after an accident.
                Very strong emotional points and points about the human psyche are portrayed in a very casual and everyday manner. For example, to some extent Yato’s existence depends upon Hiyori. Does he then have feelings of attachment for her because of this ‘need’ to exist or because she is one of the few people who can see him and enjoy his company. I suppose their relationship is a product of their circumstances. But what will happen to them when these circumstances change?
                In this, I have covered the part which spoke to me rather than writing about Yato’s character (which was the other thing of interest). Even Bishamon’s flaws are highlighted in all her appearances. Which was the other thing with this anime – the flaws of the Gods rather than the humans seemed to be driving the story forward.
                Yato – didn’t charge more than 5 Yen for a job. Bought lucky charms to help him reach his goal. Didn’t really discuss his plans, history or thoughts with his friends. But willingly suffered pain for his shinki to make it learn a lesson. Took the shinki under his wing and understood what he was feeling even if he didn’t handle Yuki’s descent into sin in a good way.
                Bishamon – Powerful lady. Takes in stray spirits as shinki to keep them safe and gives them a place to live. This caused dissatisfaction among the shinki, till it reached the point that one shinki killed the rest and wanted to turn her into a puppet. Bisha was aware of their pain, and it caused her pain, but she hid it from everyone. Instead she used medicines to numb her pain causing her to become detached from her shinki.
                Gods in Heaven – kill Ebisu without waiting to hear his side of the story. Their judgement is final.
                Tenjin – fires his shinki when she causes him corruption.
                Kofuku – Goddess of Misfortune. Is quick to react. She wants to be part of life even though she knows she brings misfortune.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Big Fish and Begonia
                Amazing animation. Beautiful scenery.
                Did not understand point of the story.
                The story is about a girl called Chun who travels to the human world as part of her society’s coming-to-age ceremony. The ceremony involves being transformed into a red dolphin which travel to the human world via a portal. They have seven days to experience the human world and then return. During this time Chun develops tender feelings for a sailor. On the day of her return, it happens that she is caught in a net. The sailor rescues her but in panic she hits his head with her tail causing him to pass out and drown.
                Chun is heartbroken as she returns to her world. She is burdened by the death, moreso, because his younger sister is now alone. However, the Southkeeper gives her an opportunity to bring back the sailor for half her life. She agrees. He is given to her in the form of a baby dolphin. She takes care of him as he grows. In her world, strange weather phenomena start taking place.
                The elder’s of her society get suspicious. They realise who is responsibleand start chasing her. Her friend Qiu tries to protect her. He even tries to get rid of the dolphin because he is jealous and worried about Chun.
                But he exchanges his entire life for Chun’s and helps the two of them escape to the human world. Chun is moved by Qiu’s sacrifice and promises to remember him.
                At the end, Qiu ends up the Southkeeper’s home where he is to take his place.
                The story touches on interesting topics –
                Ø  She tried to save the sailor – it created a situation where several people died
                Ø  Qiu’s sacrifice for Chun – Chun’s sacrifice for Jun
                Ø  The elder grandpa who sacrificed himself.
                Ø  When Chun sacrificed herself to save everyone
                Ø  The lonely soulkeeper
                I didn’t like all this sacrificing reminds me of gift of the magi
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Kamisama no Asobi - Harem style. Girl is transported to an alternate dimension where she has to teach Gods of various mythologies what it means to be human.
                The anime was simple and passed easily. It had a normal amount of overdone drama. All gods were loud and had a fatal hubris to get over except Dionysus. No god of wine will have emotional problems lol.
                The story plot was a bit implausible with unclear character development. Had random side characters.
                There was a lot of harp about the girl being special, and how all the gods liked her. Seems unreal – she is very ordinary. She was a softie but got her point across to authority when it was needed.
              </p>

              <p>Kamisama hajimemashita - Fantasy. Romance. Mild adventure.
                Story of a gutsy girl who becomes the owner of a shrine and a belligerent familiar/care-taker.
                The story follows Nanami as she grows into her role as a God (of a shrine). She is assisted heavily by Tomoe. However, her ‘weakness’ strengthwise doesn’t stop her from giving it back to Tomoe or doing whatever she thinks is right.
                His constant presence and attention makes her fall in love and she tells him that. However, he rejects her as he is in love with someone else.
                His previous love is killing him (sounds familiar). With a little time travel we discvoer that Nanami herself is the previous love and in the end manages to save him from his curse.
                The second season, follows her as she goes to Tengu mountain. She has become stronger, smarter and more creative. She saves the mountain king from turning into a mindless army for a bad guy.
                Also, she and Akuro-on help each other escape from the underworld and in the process earns his respect.
                Nanami is a good, strong-willed but weak body main character.
              Tomoe is a generic, brooding, powerful, underestimating male protagonist.

              <p>Elementary - conistently good tv series. Their cases did not get monotonous. The small moments Joan and Sherlock had were appreciable.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Brooklyn 99 - awesome stuff. Didnt like it in the beginning.. Nice as a a dinner watch. Nice characters
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Witcher - nice tv series. Not super powerful but had its own pace of progressing. Timeline was a little confusing (but the book was like that as well. Interwove the timeline between chapters). Nice characters. Yennefer had an interesting development.. Geralt is so freaking hot. His thought process doesnt seem to be much though.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Freud - really weird average occult-ish story which i was not expecting. Brilliant acting.
